# Deploy Test

This README documents a simple deploy test using Vite and React.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to set up and deploy a minimal React application powered by Vite. It leverages Vite's fast development environment and React's component-based architecture.

## Features

- Fast development with Vite
- React integration
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- ESLint for code quality

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
3. Build for production:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## Deployment

After building, deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to your preferred hosting service. Vite optimizes the build for production, making deployment straightforward.
